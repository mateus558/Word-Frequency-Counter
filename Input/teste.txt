We must not underrate the gravity of the task which lies before us
or the temerity of the ordeal, to which we shall not be found unequal.
We must expect many disappointments, and many unpleasant surprises,
but we may be sure that the task which we have freely accepted is one
not beyond the compass and the strength of the British Empire and the
French Republic.
